# qBittorrent Helper Scripts

This small, but useful collection of scripts are a fantastic way to help you manage, maintain and prune your Torrent file lists.

They automate some of the tasks that become a bit boring after clicking buttons from within the client itself for the 350th time...

There are FOUR main scripts and several sub-scripts that are specific purpose.

Download the lot, review and modify them to suit your needs. 

### AddqBittorrentTrackers.sh
This script injects trackers into your **qBittorrent downloads**.


### AddTransmissionTrackers.sh
This script injects trakers inside the **Transmission torrent**


### TransmissionRemoveCompleteTorrent.sh
This script removes completed torrents. It uses `transmission-remote`. Normally this is already installed if you use transmission.


### qBittorrentHardlinksChecker.sh
This script checks qBittorrents Hard Links.
