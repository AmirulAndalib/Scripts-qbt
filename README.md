# qBittorrent Helper Scripts

This small, but useful collection of scripts are a fantastic way to help you manage, maintain and prune your Torrent file lists.

They automate some of the tasks that become a bit boring after clicking buttons from within the client itself for the 350th time...

There are FOUR main scripts and several sub-scripts that are specific purpose.

Download the lot, review and modify them to suit your needs.

This script injects trackers into your **qBittorrent downloads**.


### AddTransmissionTrackers.sh
This script injects trakers inside the **Transmission torrent**


### TransmissionRemoveCompleteTorrent.sh
This script removes completed torrents.


### qBittorrentHardlinksChecker.sh
This script checks qBittorrents Hard Links.


# FEEDBACK and ERRORS

Please star this project - if you find a problem, please do report it.

While the scripts do not change often, the project is regualrly reviewed.  The world of Torrenting is well established, but tweaks, tricks and usage evolves.

As things evolve, these scripts will be updated.  If you would like to add, suggest ideas or propose new methods, please do open either an Issue or pop me a message.



# TODO
Make some good expalation on how to use these scripts - see the Wiki (top)
